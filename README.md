#LikhaLikhse
LikhaLikhse (name may change) is intended 
to be a cross-platform word processor to facilitate productivity and creativity for Lisan-ud-Dawat centric projects. 
We intend to develop the following features:
*A word processor
*A citation/bibliography manager
*Spell check/dictionary
Languages to be focused on: Lisan ud Dawat, Arabic, English

##Word Processing
LikhaLikhse will use Unicode in order to consistently display text across platforms. However it will also support both live and batch conversion to and from the currently-used format (double-press) used to type in Lisan ud Dawat. In addition, we will also try to support live Latin-Arabic input conversion. 
Similarly, it will support and facilitate established style conventions (such as those found in Manshuraat, and those used in Jamea) with an emphasis on ease of use. 
Our goal is to make an offline web app, or at least a standalone cross-platform program for PCs.
##Spell check/dictionary
We will use the hunspell library to support spellcheck. In order to generate the required files, we will use a web-based app supporting annotation and definition.
##Citation/Bibliography Manager
We will try to implement Aljameatus Saifiyah's Transliteration and Referencing guidelines in this software. This includes support for citations management, like that found in Microsoft Word.
